# Jupyter Notebook Analysis README

This README provides an overview of the Jupyter Notebook analysis conducted on the provided dataset. The analysis involves several steps, including importing packages, loading data, data cleaning, data visualization, normalization, and KMeans analysis.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of time series data spanning from the year 1900 to 2017. It contains 15 columns representing various features recorded over time.

## Analysis Steps

### 1. Import Packages
The first step in the analysis is to import necessary Python packages. This includes libraries for data manipulation (e.g., pandas), visualization (e.g., matplotlib), and machine learning (e.g., scikit-learn).

### 2. Load Data
Data loading involves reading the dataset into the Jupyter Notebook environment. The dataset is typically stored in a CSV file or other common data formats. The pandas library is commonly used to load data into a DataFrame.

### 3. Data Cleaning
Data cleaning is performed to ensure that the dataset is accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis. This includes handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting data types.

### 4. Data Visualization
Data visualization is used to explore patterns and relationships within the dataset. Various plots such as line plots, scatter plots, and histograms are created to visualize the distribution and trends in the data.

### 5. Normalization
Normalization is a preprocessing step used to scale numerical features to a standard range. This ensures that all features have the same scale and prevents certain features from dominating others in the analysis.

### 6. KMeans Analysis
KMeans analysis is performed to identify clusters within the dataset. This unsupervised machine learning algorithm groups similar data points together based on their features. The number of clusters is determined based on domain knowledge or using techniques such as the elbow method.

## Conclusion
By following these analysis steps, we gain insights into the structure and patterns present in the dataset. The Jupyter Notebook provides a reproducible and interactive environment for conducting data analysis and sharing results.

For detailed implementation and code, please refer to the Jupyter Notebook files in the repository.
